**Author:** Muhaned Alhashimy  
**Date:** Aug 1, 2025  
**Environment:** Kali Linux (VM)  
**Status:** ✅ Completed & Verified

## 🧠 Overview

This report simulates a real-world security misconfiguration where a sensitive file in a Linux system was left with insecure permissions (`777`). The lab explores how attackers can exploit this, and how security analysts can:

- Apply the **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)**
- Use **ACLs** to enforce role-based access
- Monitor file access activity with **auditd**
- Detect unauthorized access and fix the misconfiguration
